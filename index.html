<br>new version</br>
<p>Who is it for?
The Africa Venture brings together exceptional emerging leaders from across Africa who are in the early to mid-stage of their careers. The participants are recognized as those who will rapidly progress to more senior roles. Each participant group includes a diverse mix drawn from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.

All applications will be reviewed by the Africa Venture Selection Group, composed of senior leaders from organizations across the continent and across the sectors.
The participants will:

• develop their Cultural Intelligence (CQ): the ability to cross boundaries and thrive in multiple cultures
• enhance their ability to lead beyond authority – the ability to lead in situations where they have no formal authority.
• build diverse networks with exceptional emerging leaders from across the continent, whom they would never otherwise meet

About the Africa Venture
The Africa Venture develops emerging leaders from across Africa through a leadership programme that includes focused, personal, privileged and generous interaction between this rising generation of leaders and former Heads of State and Government from the World Leadership Alliance-Club de Madrid.
 MUHIGIRWA KINYUNYI, Strategy and Operation Member LUCHA, The Democratic Republic Of The Congo
“I had a good moment with people from different sectors, from different countries, but very engaged to the development of Africa and ready to work on the connectivity of Africa.”

How does it work?
Applied learning
Throughout the programme, we emphasize helping the candidates to learn to apply the leadership concepts which are taught.

In the first half of the programme, we do so by presenting the participants with a practical and compelling challenge facing Africa today. They work together, using their leadership learning, to find solutions to the challenge. The challenge is set by a Think Tank made up of senior leaders from across the continent. This year’s challenge is: How can we use technological innovation to improve healthcare in Africa?

In the second half of the programme, participants begin to apply their leadership learning to a challenge which they identify from within their own workplace. They are encouraged to share the learning from this as they proceed, and at the final contact module, they report back on progress and learn from each other’s experiences.

COVID-19 update

This year we have devised a highly interactive real-time online modules, providing stimulating real-time digital engagement for participants while they are still in varying degrees of lockdown. They will engage with  key global leaders focusing on applicable solutions to current world realities.

 

Blended learning
The programme follows a blended learning approach, with two  asynchronous phases interspersed with two highly interactive real-time online modules, completed over four months.

A final in-person alumni module enables the participants to gather in a leading African city and embed their learning.

The two real-time online sessions comprise four and three intensive days of learning, respectively, and the in-person alumni module comprises of three days.

The programme is highly experiential:participants visit organizations across the continent and engage in discussions with senior leaders from across the public, private and NGO sectors.

All of these engagement take place virtually this year, while the in-person alumni module will allow forphysical exploration of the host city.
